# Master
The module geography.py contains all functions used for my master project:
- create of a setting file for quantiNEMO with a random sampling
- calculate coordinates of sampled populations (with the corresponding continent)
- calculate pairwise distances
- calculate distance from Addis Ababa
- create of STRUCTURE file (and a second one with the population for the PCA per population).
